## 4.1 Establish an Organizational Test Strategy

### 4.1.1 Important DevOps Practices 
Value-driven organizations use DevOps as an approach to deliver value faster throughout all the steps in its value streams. Hence an organizational test strategy needs to include practices supporting DevOps in order to accelerate the flow in value streams and be more responsive to stakeholder needs in an ever-changing environment. Organizations need to decide on the relative importance of the various practices.

A generic DevOps infinite loop, a common visualization of the development and operations stages, consists of six stages:  operate, monitor, explore, code, integrate and release

DevOps supports trends like shift-right that were not common in either traditional development or test approaches . An organizational test strategy needs to incorporate activities like building relationships across the organization, monitoring, and testing in production. All system environments in DevOps are designed for resilience, which helps enable testing in production.

Additional aspects that help to build quality into the DevOps process include:

Operating in DevOps

* Use of feature toggles
* Automated control and management of test and production environments used during release stage  
* Testing in production
* Canary releases

Monitoring in DevOps  

Exploring in DevOps

* Hypothesis-driven development used for creating a minimum viable product (MVP) during exploration

Coding and integrating in DevOps

Releasing in DevOps

* Self-service environment management
* Blue/green deployment strategy and chaos engineering

For organizations where DevOps is not a mature capability the organizational test strategy should outline improvement goals and how to contribute to higher DevOps maturity.

### 4.1.2 Create and Implement an Organizational Test Strategy
Test strategies exist on different levels: organizational, product and operational . This certification focuses on test strategy on an organizational level.

Value-driven organizations can reuse elements from existing test strategies. Some traditional test strategies like consultative, regression-averse and model-based approaches are particularly relevant and inspiring in this context.

When creating an organizational test strategy, agile test leaders can draw inspiration from the definitions of done (DoD) of agile teams. Similarly, an organizational test strategy may define essential elements that all teams must have in their DoD as a minimum.  

Just like a DoD the organizational test strategy should be a lightweight, user-friendly and a “living” artefact.

An organizational test strategy can be developed and adapted by interested stakeholders collaborating within a communitiy of practice (CoP), especially if the community is topic-based rather than role-based.

Tailoring an organizational test strategy may follow a tailoring-down or a tailoring-up approach.

To avoid the organizational test strategy becoming shelf-ware agile test leaders need to encourage teams to implement experiments in order to validate practices from the organizational test strategy.

In order to involve all interested stakeholders, agile test leaders need to actively lead the implementation using change leadership. One model for leading change on an individual level is called ADKAR

### 4.1.3 Validate Alignment of Test Practices with Business and Technical Needs 
Another important aspect of implementing the organizational test strategy is to be able to assess whether or not it helps the organization to deliver on the organizational business and technical strategy.

In value-driven organizations testing and quality should be embedded in the organization and the assessment of test practices should happen in the context of development and not as a separate area. Quality and testing practices are naturally covered in assessments focusing on DevOps or organizational agility.

An agile test leader can propose to use a suitable maturity model to assess an organization’s capabilities or the competencies of an organizational unit or a single team. A DevOps health radar is an example of a maturity model that also covers quality and testing areas. For more details about maturity models focusing on test process improvement see Expert Level in *Improving the Testing Process* (ISTQB®, 2011)

Assessments on organizational level have several disadvantages that risk disempowering and disengaging the teams responsible for the assessed capabilities. Self-assessments, either facilitated or fully self-managed, are more suitable for a value-driven organization. Which approach to use depends on the organizational scope of the assessment, maturity of the teams and the culture of the organization, especially related to psychological safety.

It is also important to consider what to measure. Maturity models that take a holistic view usually measure three areas: outcomes in terms of business value, outputs in terms of delivery and performance and maturity in terms of people and processes.

Depending on the purpose of the assessment, the method used and the maturity of the organization an assessment can be conducted in different manners. An agile test leader can conduct the typical steps in a facilitated self-assessment which includes planning, conducting and concluding the self-assessment.

## 4.2 Fit Agile Test Leadership in a Value-Driven Organization

### 4.2.1 Organizational, Product and Operational Level
Organizations need certain quality and testing capabilities in order to deliver quality products and services. Agile test leadership has to ensure that the organizational test strategy describing these capabilities is aligned with and supports the business strategy. The agile test leader can also evaluate the current quality and testing capabilities, question ineffective or inefficient practices and facilitate a possible adjustment of the organizational strategy.

On organizational level improvements often go beyond what even teams of agile teams can achieve on their own because they require a coordinated effort and significant funding. The agile test leader can support such large initiatives by providing business stakeholders with a business case to justify investments and metrics to measure success.

In a value-driven organization, budget allocation often includes a broad set of stakeholders with different perspectives. The agile test leader may contribute to this process by analyzing trade-offs related to quality and testing.

On product level the scale is smaller than the entire organization but larger than a single team. Here the agile test leader can:

* be a practice leader within the testing community of practice (CoP)
*  help teams to identify waste using value stream mapping (VSM)
*  guide teams to capture product quality in their definitions of “ready” and “done”
*  teach teams systems thinking to reduce the risk of local optimization
*  facilitate multi-team retrospectives and process improvement
*  help teams with continuous improvement of their quality capabilities
*  provide System QA and testing expertise to agile teams by leading a specialized service group
*  help to find a good balance between decentralized and centralized testing

On operational level, the agile test leader can coach teams of agile teams in test related subjects (testing techniques and tools, metrics, effort estimation, risk-based testing, pairing, peer reviews, test-first practices, design for testability).

The agile test leader can also support teams of agile teams from within a specialized service group providing test related services (refactoring of a test automation framework, integration of tests into CI/CD, management of test infrastructure and tools, end-to-end and non-functional testing)

### 4.2.2 Transition from Traditional Test Management to Agile Test Leadership at Scale
During a transition from “traditional” test management to agile test leadership at scale a test manager will have to assume new responsibilities, uphold some old responsibilities and beware of anti-patterns. 

New responsibilities which arise from an agile test leader role are using value stream mapping and systems thinking, involving various disciplines along the entire value stream and speaking up in case of dysfunctions.

On the organizational level an agile test leader needs to influence strategic decisions such as identifying, establishing and sustaining testing skills and capabilities and allocating budget for funding them and identify practices to be consolidated and centralized in order to create synergies. 

Responsibilities to be continued are empowering agile (test) teams by coaching, offering training, fostering CoPs and suggesting test process improvements, providing guidance on test related topics, representing testing within the organization and being an escalation point for impediments. 

Anti-patterns to be avoided result from any behavior which would undermine the idea of self-organized and responsible agile teams such as a “command and control” type management behavior.

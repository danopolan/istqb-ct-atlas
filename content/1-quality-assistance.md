## 1.1 What is Quality Assistance?
Quality assistance is an approach to quality management that is crucial to developing and sustaining a value-driven organization.

The certification covers how quality assistance as an approach fits with known software testing concepts such as test management, quality control, and quality assurance.

Quality assistance is the approach test management should embrace to help in adopting and fostering a transformation to business agility. A quality assistance approach to test management is significantly different from a traditional mindset and traditional approach (Gartner, 2018). Some important differences are as follows:

*  Optimizes for flow and value delivery
*  Focuses on prevention, automation, and observability
*  Encourages built-in quality practices continuously
*  Supports self-empowered teams by enabling others to take responsibility for quality- and testing-related activities
*  Embeds testing throughout the organization instead of sustaining testing silos
*  Requires agile test leaders and agile test team leaders that serve, rather than test managers that control
*  Has agile test leaders and agile test team leaders helping everyone in the organization collaborate through community of practice events

It is important to understand that test management as a discipline is still needed as part of quality assistance in value-driven organizations.

## 1.2 Skills for Quality Assistance

One of the important aspects of quality assistance is to enable everyone in the organization to contribute to and take a shared responsibility for quality. The certification introduces change leadership, quality coaching, facilitation, and training as important skills for agile test leaders and agile test team leaders to succeed with quality assistance.

Change leadership is crucial to successful organizational change. It is important that quality assistance aligns with the change programs in an organization, especially programs to improve business agility. Change leadership includes human aspects, which affects people’s capacity to deal with change as well as fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

Quality coaching is a skill using a set of activities focused on helping the agile organization deal with quality-related topics. It is a collaborative dialog that promotes reflection in teams or with a single person. Conditions for effective quality coaching are also covered as part of this certification.

Facilitation is a skill in quality assistance that encourages people to use their knowledge and skills to reach a desired outcome. Facilitation is important to engage everyone and to build a shared responsibility for quality.

Training is a skill to help people build their skills. A variety of methods are introduced to cater for different needs and purposes. In order to scale the training it is important to engage the relevant organizational departments that support employees’ skill growth and career development.

Since each of the above skills are disciplines in their own right, it is important to see them as part of a continuous learning pathway. There are other skills that can be used to serve the organization, such as mentoring or consulting, but these are out of scope for this certification.

How to use the four skills is elaborated in future chapters (see syllabus outline in section 0.8, How this Syllabus is Organized).
